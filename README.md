# Temp-Humidity-Logger
Arduino code for temp-humidty logging to ThingSpeak
Questions to geiserw@gmail.com

In addition to the TempHumid_logger.ino file with the Arduino code in it, you will need to supply a file named SecretStuff.h.
In it will be two lines:

#define SSID "The name of your local WiFi network"
#define PASS "The password for your local WiFi network"

I did not include this file for obvious reasons.
